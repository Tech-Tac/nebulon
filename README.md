# Nebulon

A multi-platform native Discord client, aiming to provide the usual Discord experience with less resource usage and extra quality of life changes.

## Disclaimers

If you use this client, there is a (small) chance your account may receive bans or limitations, as is theoretically the case with any non-official client, so use this at your own risk and with accounts you don't mind potentially losing.

This project is still early in development and is generally not _yet_ usable for daily chatting, however, you can help mature this project by contributing.

## Main Features

- **Near-native performance**: no more resource-hungry Chromium instances or Javascript runtimes.

And that's about it for now, but there are other features planned and being worked on, including:

- **Background notifications**: get notifications from all of your accounts without having to keep the app open and consuming memory.

- **Modular UI**: fullscreen a particular channel or pop it into its own window.

- **Customization**: customize your interface theme globally or per-server.

If you want a feature added, you can open an issue and/or start working on it. Please note that features that violate Discord's terms of service won't be accepted.
