# Nebulon

A multi-platform native Discord client written in Flutter, aiming to provide the usual Discord experience with less resource usage and extra quality of life changes.

Supports **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux**, in addition to **Android** and **iOS**.

## Disclaimers

If you use this client, there is a *small* chance your account may receive bans or limitations, as is theoretically the case with any non-official client, so use this at your own risk and with accounts you don't mind potentially losing.

> This project is still early in development and is generally not *yet* usable for daily chatting, however, you can help mature this project by contributing.

## Main Features

- **Near-native performance**: no more resource-hungry Chromium instances or Javascript runtimes.

Work in progress:

- **Background notifications**: get notifications from all of your accounts without having to keep the app open and consuming memory.

- **Modular UI**: fullscreen a particular channel or pop it into its own window.

- **Customization**: customize your interface theme globally or per-server.

If you want a feature added, you can open an issue and/or start working on it. Please note that features that violate Discord's terms of service won't be accepted.
